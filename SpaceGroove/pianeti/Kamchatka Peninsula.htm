    <p style="padding: 50px;">Sitting along the northwest rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire, Kamchatka is one of the most volcanically active parcels of land in the world. At least 300 volcanoes dot the peninsula, and at least 29 of them are active.
        <br><br>The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAâ€™s Terra satellite caught a glimpse of plumes rising from two of them, Shiveluch and Klyuchevskaya, in January 2018.</p>
