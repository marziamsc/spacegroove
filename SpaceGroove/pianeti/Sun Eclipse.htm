    <p style="padding: 50px;">This photograph of an eclipse of the Sun was taken with a 16mm motion picture camera from the Apollo 12 spacecraft during its trans-Earth journey home from the Moon in November 1969. The fascinating view was created when the Earth moved directly between the Sun and the Apollo 12 spacecraft.</p>
